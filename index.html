      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Isidro Benítez, and I am a passionate IT Engineer. I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering user-friendly solutions. This space showcases my journey, projects, and interests.</p>

    <section id="career">
      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>With over 10 years of self-directed learning, complemented by professional training and academic pursuits, I have built a strong foundation in technology. My journey began with a vocational degree in IT Systems Administration (ASIR), where I honed practical skills in managing networks and systems.</p>
      <p>Building on this, I pursued a degree in Computer Engineering specializing in Information Technologies. This academic experience broadened my expertise in software development, systems design, and emerging technologies. Throughout this time, I have worked on personal projects, collaborated with peers, and stayed committed to continuous growth in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://haloespana.es/">Maintenance of the Halo España Website</a></h3>
        <small>December 2023 - Present</small>
        <p>I am responsible for the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the web server for the Halo España community. The website is based on WordPress and runs on a LAMP infrastructure. My role focuses on technical management, ensuring everything operates smoothly, while also contributing articles to the website in my spare time.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2938702672">The Flood: The Forgotten Exile</a></h3>
        <small>April 2023 - Present</small>
        <p>I worked on adapting the original version of the mod "The Flood: The Forgotten Exile" from Halo: Custom Edition to Halo: The Master Chief Collection. My responsibilities included adapting and recompiling the map, fixing bugs, and programming the code for the cooperative version of the mod, as Halo CE did not originally support this feature. I also maintain the mod on the Steam Workshop, handle feedback, and ensure its proper functionality.</p>

        <small>May 2022</small>
        <p>A Linux server based on the Raspbian distribution, combined with Octoprint and automated using Shell scripting. The setup allows connections either via DDNS over the Internet or through an OpenVPN server. It also includes an FTP server and a video streaming system for real-time print monitoring. Hardware used includes a Raspberry Pi B2 and a Creality Ender 3 Pro printer. This project earned the highest grade in my vocational training final project.</p>
